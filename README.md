Expensify: Full-Stack Expense Management System
üöÄ Overview
Expensify is a robust, role-based web application designed to automate and streamline the corporate expense reimbursement process. It features multi-level, conditional approval workflows, secure user management, and mock functionality for advanced features like OCR receipt scanning and real-time currency conversion.

This project uses a classic MERN-style stack (excluding React/Vue for the frontend component) with a persistent MongoDB database to ensure data integrity and accessibility.

‚ú® Core Features
Role-Based Access: Dedicated dashboards and permissions for Admin, Manager, and Employee.

Secure Authentication: User signup (Admin only initially) and login with persistent sessions.

Hierarchical User Management (Admin): Create, assign roles (Manager/Employee), assign managers, and delete users.

Advanced Approval Workflow:

Sequential: Expenses route through a defined chain (Manager ‚Üí Finance ‚Üí Director).

Conditional/Hybrid Rules: Admin can configure rules like Percentage Approval (e.g., 60% approval is auto-approved) or Specific Approver Override.

Employee Features: Submit expense claims (with currency conversion mock), view submission history, and track status.

Manager Features: View pending approvals from direct reports/team, approve/reject claims with comments, and view team expenses.

Simulated OCR: Front-end mock functionality to auto-fill expense forms from a simulated receipt scan.
